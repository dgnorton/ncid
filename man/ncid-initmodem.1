.SH NAME
.B ncid-initmodem
- use ncidd to reinitialize modem to Caller ID mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
ncid --no-gui --program
.B ncid-initmodem
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ncid-initmodem
output module re-initializes the modem obtaining the Caller ID
for the server.  It can only be used if the modem supports Caller ID and
sends "RING" at each ringing signal.  If the server indicates a non-CID
call, ncid-initmodem will cause ncidd to re-initialize the modem for CID.
Never use this module with a modem that does not support Caller ID.  The
module can be used with TiVo modems that drop out of Caller ID mode.
