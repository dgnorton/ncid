These are CID gateways that pull CID information off the network
and input it to the NCID server.

sip2ncid       - SIP gateway: receives CID information from SIP Invite packets
                 and sends it as a CID message line to the NCID server
sip2ncid.conf  - configuration file for sip2ncid
yac2ncid       - YAC gateway: receives CID information from a YAC server
                 and sends it as a CID message line to the NCID server
yac2ncid.conf  - configuration file for yac2ncid

The Makefile is used to create the runable scripts.

	prefix2 controls where to look for the config file,
	(the default is /usr/local)

Recommend sip2ncid instead of sip2ncid
    ncidsip        - OLD SIP gateway replaced by sip2ncid
    ncidsip.conf   - OLD configuration file for ncidsip-init
