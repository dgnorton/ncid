ncid - Network CallerID Install

INSTALL:

	Download the tcl/tk interpreter:
		For Mac system 7 or greater, but not Mac OS X
		- http://www.tcl.tk/software/mac/
		For Mac OS X
		- http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10894

	Install tcl/tk:
		- Run the file downloaded

	Install ncid:
        - The NCID package normally installs in /usr/local:
        - If a binary package is available:
            Copy ncid-VERSION.mac-osx.tgz to the mac, then:
                tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION-mac-osx.tgz -C /
                EXAMPLE: tar -xzvf ncid-0.64.mac-osx.tgz -C /
        - if there is no binary package, you need to compile the source:
            Copy ncid-VERSION.tar.gz
            cd ncid
            make mac (compiles for /usr/local, see top of Makefile)
            make install-mac

CONFIGURE:

    The Makefile preconfigures ncidd.conf for the Mac, but you may
    want to change some of the defaults.

START:

    - start the server and client:
        ncidd
        ncid &
    - Call yourself and see if it works.

TESTT USING A MODEM:

    - The easiest way to test the setup is to run ncidd in debug mode,
      it will stay attached to the terminal and not go into deamon mode:
		ncidd -D
    - to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    - to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5

    - The last line should be: Modem set for CallerID.
    - If it says: ERROR
      try the CID strings in ncidd.conf or in doc/CID-init

    - Call yourself and you should see the CallerID lines.
    - If you only see RING for each ring, the modem does not support
      Caller ID.  You should see the Caller ID lines betreen the
      first and second RING.
    - If you see: /dev/ttyS1: No such file or directory
      you need to set sttyclocal in ncidd.conf

    - At any point, you can use command lines options to vary
      things like modem init and CID init.

	- Once it works, you would normally start it:
        ncidd

TEST USING NCIDSIP:

Start (in this order):
    ncidd
    ncidsip (may need to add options, review Setup-VOIP)
    ncid

    Call yourself

    if you have problems, start ncidd in debug mode:
        - ncidd -D
    to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5
    The last line should be: CallerID from CID client(s) only

    Once you solve any problems, restart ncidd normally

TEST USING A DEVICE (like the NetCallerID box):

    Start ncidd then ncid
    Call yourself

    if you have problems, start ncidd in debug mode:
        - ncidd -D
    to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5
    The Last line should be: CallerID TTY port initialized.

    Once you solve any problems, restart ncidd normally
