		For Mac OS X
		- http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10894

	Install tcl/tk:

	Install ncid:
        - The NCID package normally installs in /usr/local:
            /usr/local/sbin/ncidd
            /usr/local/bin/ncid
            /usr/local/bin/cidalias
            /usr/local/bin/cidlog
            /usr/local/bin/cidlogupd
            /usr/local/share/ncid/README-page
            /usr/local/share/ncid/ncid-page
            /usr/local/share/ncid/ncid-samba
            /usr/local/share/ncid/ncid-speak
            /usr/local/share/ncid/ncidrotate
            /usr/local/etc/ncidd.conf
            /usr/local/man/man1/ncid.1
            /usr/local/man/man1/ncidscripts.1
            /usr/local/man/man1/ncidtools.1
            /usr/local/man/man5/ncidd.conf.5
            /usr/local/man/man8/ncidd.8
            /var/log/cidcall.log
        - If a binary package is available:
            Copy ncid-VERSION.mac-osx.tgz to the mac, then:
                tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION.mac-osx.tgz -C /
                EXAMPLE: tar -xzvf ncid-0.50.mac-osx.tgz -C /
        - if there is no binary package, you need to compile the source:
            Copy ncid-VERSION.tar.gz
            cd ncid
            make mac (compiles for /usr/local, see top of Makefile)
            make install-mac

CONFIGURE:

    The Makefile preconfigures ncidd.conf for the Mac, but you may
    want to change some of the defaults.

START:

    - start the server and client:
        ncidd
        ncid &
    - Call yourself and see if it works.

TEST:

    - The easiest way to test the setup is to run ncidd in debug mode,
      it will stay attached to the terminal and not go into deamon mode:
		ncidd -D
    - to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dvv
    - to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dvvv

    - The last line should be: Modem set for CallerID.
    - If it says: ERROR
      try the CID strings in ncidd.conf or in doc/CID-init

    - Call yourself and you should see the CallerID lines.
    - If you only see RING for each ring, the modem does not support
      Caller ID.  You should see the Caller ID lines betreen the
      first and second RING.
    - If you see: /dev/ttyS1: No such file or directory
      you need to set sttyclocal in ncidd.conf

    - At any point, you can use command lines options to vary
      things like modem init and CID init.

	- Once it works, you would normally start it:
        ncidd
