Specific distribution Changes:

    Fedora and Redhat:
	    ncidd.init: updated
        The lockfile defaults to /var/spool/lock/lockdev instead of /var/lock/

    FreeBSD:
        The lockfile defaults to /var/spool/lock instead of /var/lock/

    Mac OS-X:
        The system poll() function is either not fully functional or it
        fully implemented.  The replacement poll.c and poll.h source
        files were added back so poll() functions properly with ncidd.

        The lockfile defaults to /var/spool/uucp/ instead of /var/lock/

    Ubuntu:
	    ncidd.init: updated

    TiVo:

    Windows:

NCID Server Changes:

    ncidd:
        Outgoing and hungup calls are always sent to the clients

        Clients are tracked by a file descriptor and IP address.

        Added, improved, and fixed messages in the log file.

        Fixed a bug using a gateway for Caller ID and the
        hangup option.  It initialized the modem on startup
        without creating a lockfile and interfered with a
        program using the modem.

	    Improved modem code and hangup code.

        Improved log messages for reloading alias and blacklist files.

    ncidd.conf:
        removed "send outcall"

NCID Gateway Changes:
