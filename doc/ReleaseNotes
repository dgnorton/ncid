Fixed the ncid client to properly parse a message for a optional LINE
field, when "LINE" is part of a caller name.

The server was modified to send additional MSG lines to clients and
the logfile.  The MSG lines will indicate starup, termination, errors,
when a another program takes control of the modem, and when the modem
is free for use again.

TiVo Packages:
    - The server cidcall.log file, has been moved from /var/hack/log
      to /var/log.
