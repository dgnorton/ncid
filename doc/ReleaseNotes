Added ncid client output module for MythTV.

Created a installer package for the windows ncid client.

Fixed bus error problem caused by a NULL pointer in the server.

Eliminated the server "TTY in use" and "TTY available messages" from
the cidcall.log and clients.  They are only available in debug mode.

Added modem country setting information to the doc/Modem-init file.

Organized all server debug messages to print through a single function.

The server debug syntax changed: For maximum output it is -Dvvv instead
of the previous -DDv.

Added a TODO list, in the source, to indicate possible directions, and
to encourage suggestions and submissions of patches for new features.
