NCID was modified to accept NCIDINFO messages.  This allows the
CID client to send a CANCEL message when a call is aborted before
pickup.  The client can test for this and output to a output module
when it receives a CANCEL notification.  Thus a cell phone can be
sent a message only if the phone is not picked up.

NCIDsip was improved.

TiVo display fixed and updated to display line indicator and messages.

Updated man pages for ncid and ncidsip.

Updated documentation.
