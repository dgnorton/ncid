There is now a Cygwin package that runs under windows.  It is
limited.  It will not handle a modem, but works with a CID client
on another computer.  The distributed CID client requires a perl
module: Net::Pcap which does not seem to build under cygwin.

The server can now receive Caller ID information from a client
that sends a CID message to the server.  There is one client
available that can send a CID message, but others are possible,
including ones to monitor modems on different platforms.

NCID has a SIP Invite client called 'ncidsip'.  It uses SIP Invite
to get the CID information for a VoIP call and sends it to the server
as a CID Message.  It handles multiple VoIP lines, and has been tested
with Vonage.

NCID can handle multiple VoIP lines and one normal telephone line.
It can also handle multiple VoIP lines and multiple distinctive
ring numbers.  It can also handle multiple clients that send CID
messages.

A new option called "noserial" tells ncidd there is no modem or serial
device attached to it.  A CID device is no longer a requirement if a
client supplies the CID.

Line identifiers can now be aliased in ncidd.  Distinctive Ring and
the SIP client produce line identifiers which can be changed by an
alias.  If there is no line indicator, ncidd generates a default one
to send to its clients.  The default one is not displayed by ncid.
You can alias the default line identifier so it will be displayed
by ncid, and you can alias a received line indicator to the default
so ncid will not display it.  Usage is in the ncidd.alias file.

The client by default outputs 5 lines to a output module.  The --all
option is still there but should not be used as it will be removed.  A
new option, --tivo, outputs the single line that was the default.

All ncid output modules were rewritten to read 5 input lines.  So
far, only ncid-page makes use of the new LINE indicator input.  All
references to --all were removed from all output modules.

Fixed very important problems in ncidd polling.

Fixed the '-s' option.

Fixed ncidd so it will recover, in most cases, when it resumes from a
program that takes over the modem but leaves data in the modem buffer
when it terminates.  The program "qpage" will still cause ncidd not to
recover unless a simple fix is applied to qpage.

Fixed ncidd so it will not truncate some large files when sent to clients.

Improved server logging and output from the various verbose levels.

Modified ncidd to work with the motorola modems in a Mini Mac.
