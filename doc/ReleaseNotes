NCID Server Changes:

    ncidd:
        Sends outgoing calls to the clients if ncidd is configured for
        it, and if the gateway supports it.  The ncid client must also
        be configured to display outgoing calls.

        Outgoing calls are always logged in the call file if the SIP
        gateway supports them.

    ncidd.conf:
        Updated for the new outgoing call send option.

NCID Gateway Changes:

    ncid2ncid:

    sip2ncid:
        Outgoing calls are handled better than before.

        End of calls now indicate if it is a outgoing or incomming call.

    yac2ncid:

NCID Client Changes:

    ncid:
        Added new country codes: NONE, DE (Germany), and UK (United Kingdom)

        Added ability to enable the display outgoing calls.  The outgoing
        call display has a new field that displays callin or callout.  The
        ncidd server must support and be configured for outgoing calls.

        Fixed startup to use NoGUI in ncid.conf.

        Replaced the --call-prog|-C option with --call-out|-C option

    ncid.conf
        Added new country codes: NONE, DE (Germany), and UK (United Kingdom)

        Added new variable "CallOut" to determine if outgoing calls are
        to be displayed.
