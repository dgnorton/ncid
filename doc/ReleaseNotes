Server Changes:

    Modified server code (again) so it should never abort when a external
    program takes over and does not properly release the modem.

Client Changes:

    Modified the  ncid client to only format 7, 10, or 11 digit
    telephone numbers.  Unformatted numbers will have "BAD-" in
    front of it.

    Added a message option to ncid to send messages to a output module.
    Output modules that support messages require this option.

    Added new ncid symbolic link (TiVo only), tivoncid, that uses
    ncid-tivo instead of out2osd.

Client Module Changes:

    Modified the ncid-mythtv output module to handle messages.

    Added a new ncid output module called ncid-tivo that uses
    the TiVo text2osd display distributed with it.  This gives
    a choice of two display methods.  It should always work with
    a new OS release.

    Updated comments in all output modules.

Script changes:

    Fixed the broken cidupdate.

Documentation Changes:

    Updated documentation.
    Added "VerboseLevels" to document the server verbose levels.
