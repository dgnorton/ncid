    Windows:

NCID Server Changes:

    ncidd:
        Added TIME fields to CIDINFO

        Added a new option "-n | --gencid" and configuration variable
        to turn on or off the feature to handle a call without Caller
        ID at ring 2.  The feature is normally enabled.

        Allows CID, CIDINFO, and MSG  data lines as input so a NCID
        gateway can input the lines directly from another NCID server

        Changed debug mode to output to stdout instead of stderr

        Giving a non-option command line argument is now rejected

        The modem code was modified to work with the Caller ID
        phone number line from telcos in Canada.

        The server will accept '\n' if the clients need to determine
        if it is still available.  This is not normally needed and
        if needed, it should be restricted to 15 minutes, or longer,
        of no activity.

    ncidd.conf:
        Added the "genkey" configuration keyword and comments on how
        to use it.

        Added comments for the Modem initialization string for the
        US Robotics 5637, v.92 56k USB modem

NCID Gateway Changes:

    ncid2ncid:
        New

        Inputs Caller ID information and messages from one or
        more NCID servers, called sending servers,  to another
        NCID server, called a receiving server,  whose clients
        will display information from all servers.  The line
        tag will indicate the phone number called.

    sip2ncid:
        Changed SIP warning messages from displaying the time to
        displaying the date and time

        Changed debug mode to output to stdout instead of stderr

        Giving a non-option command line argument is now rejected

        Fixed duplicate call indication with a PBX

        Removed test for number to be numeric.  One PBX uses names

        Fixed core dump of the -W | --warn option

    yac2ncid:
        Modified to send YAC user messages to NCID

NCID Client Changes:

    ncid:
        Patched to work with the Vodafone ARC_ncidd 0.01 server

        Improved reconnect logic

        The -C option is depreciated should not be used anymore.
