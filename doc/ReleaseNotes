The most important change this release is the SIP decode logic in sip2ncid
and ncidsip.  This fixed problems with Asterisk and some Vonage systems.

The log rotation script was updated and improved.  It uses condrestart
to restart daemons.

A user message line must start with a "MSG: " label to be recognized as a
message.  The server will no longer accept any input as a message.  The
simple food timer example now becomes (using a popular version of nc):
    sleep 600; echo "MSG: Food Ready" | nc -w1 localhost 3333 > /dev/null

The gateway data labels have changed.  They are different from the labels
used by the server when it sends information to the clients.

Debian:

    Modified the init scripts to work with the logrotate script

Fedora:

    The Fedora binary distribution can be built for previous Fedora
    and Redhat releases by rebuilding the package:

        rpmbuild -tb ncid-0.71-src.tar.gz

FreeBSD:

    Modified the rc scripts to work with the logrotate script

Mac OS-X:

    Changed Makefile so the "mac" target builds a normal binary, and added
    a "mac-fat" target to build a ppc and i386 universal binary.

NCID Server Changes:

    Sets the ring count to -2 to indicate hangup after answer
    Expects message lines to begin with "MSG"
    Expects gateway call information to begin with "CALL"

NCID Gateway Changes:

    sip2ncid:
        Rewrote the decode routines to eliminate duplicate call indications.
        Decode works with Asterisk.
        Call information sent to the server begin with "CALL".

    ncidsip:
        Rewrote the decode routines so follow same logic as sip2ncid.
        Decode works with Asterisk.
        Call information sent to the server begin with "CALL".

    yac2ncid:
        Call information sent to the server begin with "CALL".

NCID Client Changes:

    Can call output module when hangup after answer is detected.
    Try one time to connect to server, if delay is set to zero.
    New option to indicate ringing. Useful when Called ID is not available.

NCID Client Module Changes:

    ncid-mythtv: Corrected typo that prevented the display of messages.
                 Messages are enabled by default
    ncid-popup: Messages are enabled by default
    ncidmodules.conf: added configuration for mythtv and popup messages
