Windows:

    The client installer was renamed to ncid-0.70-1-client_setup.exe
    to avoid any confusion that it might be the complete NCID package.

    NCID will now run on the Windows desktop using andLinux, which is
    a complete Ubuntu Linux system running seamlessly in Windows 2000
    based 32-bit systems (2000, XP, 2003, Vista).  The minimal andLinux
    distribution is about 143 MB.

    The NCID Ubuntu package installs and upgrades easily with the GUI
    package managers.  NCID modem support in untested, but probably
    does not work, as when using Cygwin on Windows.  If you want to use
    a modem instead of SIP, use the YAC modem server and the YAC gateway.

    See http://www.andlinux.org/ for more information on andLinux.
