        NOTES:
            If you need to build a package for your specific OS release, the
            build-essential, fakeroot, & libpcap packages must be installed:

                tar -xzf ncid-0.77-src.tar.gz
                mv ncid ncid-0.77

                fakeroot debian/rules binary
                fakeroot debian/rules clean

    TiVo:
        Modified startncid to start programs only if not already running.
        Removed ncid-page from startncid script
        Added ncid-initmodem to startncid script
        Added initmodem.sh script
        The correct modem port is selected for PPC or MIPS in ncidd.conf

    Windows:

NCID Server Changes:

    ncidd:
        Added check to make sure lockfile is active, if not it is removed.

        Added a new feature to indicate a call when there no Caller ID is
        sent from a modem.  If the server does not receive the Caller ID
        from the modem by ring number 2, it will generate "RING" for the
        number and "No Caller ID" for the name.  This permits NCID to work
        with modems that indicate RING but not Caller ID.  It also permits
        ncidd to detect the modem dropping out of the Caller ID mode.

        The "initstr" and "initcid" variables in ncid.conf can be set
        to "" for the new "No Caller ID" feature.

        Fixed invalid verbose level indication when verbose is set in
        ncidd.conf.

        Changed verbose level 9 to invalid in ncidd.conf.  Level 9 can
        only be entered from the command line because it causes the
        logfile to grow at a fast rate and is not normally required.

NCID Gateway Changes:

    sip2ncid:
        Added logic to print "No SIP packets received" at start of
        problem and "SIP packets returned" at end 

        Changed wait interval to determine no SIP packets from 90 to 120

    ncidsip:

    yac2ncid:

NCID Client Changes:

    ncid:
        Eliminated the defunct process problem by not calling client
        modules in the background.

        Removed the "--nocid| -N" option because this feature is now
        handled by the server.

NCID Client Module Changes:

    ncid-hangup:
        removed the "-o" option to minicom so it works on OSX
        changed the delay method in the ncid.minicom file
        added more comments to the ncid.blacklist file

    ncid-initmodem:
        added (see ncidmodules man page for details)

    ncid-yac:
        modified to handle messages
