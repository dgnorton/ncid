Specific distribution Changes:

    Fedora:
        The Fedora binary distribution can be used on different Fedora
        releases, maybe even redhat releases.  Binary packages can be
        built for a specific Fedora or Redhat release by building the
        package from the tar source archive:
            rpmbuild -tb ncid-0.74-src.tar.gz

        Updated the ncidsip service file.

        Updated the ncid.spec file.

        Modified the service for ncid-page so the default is to send the
        Caller ID message when the call first comes in.

    FreeBSD:
        Updated the Makefile to use "make freebsd" and "make freebsd-install"
        instead of "gmake freebsd" and "gmake freebsd-install".  Gmake is
        still required.

        Modified the service for ncid-page so the default is to send the
        Caller ID message when the call first comes in.

    Mac OS-X:

    Ubuntu:

        Modified the service for ncid-page so the default is to send the
        Caller ID message when the call first comes in.

    ncidd: Small fix in error handling.

           to clients on the second ring.

        Monitors more signals, and indicates signal that caused termination.
