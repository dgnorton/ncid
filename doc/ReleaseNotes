Added support for CID systems that will output a name but
not a telephone number when call is PRIVATE or BLOCKED.

Message support has been added to ncidd and ncid.  The ncid
client, can send a short single line message to all connected
clients using the ncidd server.

Any text sent to port 3333 is considered a message.  Message support
is really intended for applications to send messages.  Here is a example
of a script for a 10 minute food timer using netcat to send the message:

    sleep 600; echo "Check food ready" | nc localhost 3333

Added a logfile for ncidd.  The configuration file has a variable
called verbose that controls how much content goes into it.  The
default is 1, but the range is 1-9.

The server debug syntax changed: For maximum output it is -Dv5 instead
of the previous -Dvvv.  The default output for -D is at the level set by
verbose.  The verbose default is 1 so -D is usually the same as -Dv1.

Applied some fixes to ncidd to prevent it from hanging when certain
programs took control of the modem.
