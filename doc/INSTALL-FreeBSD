# INSTALL ncid and ncidd on FreeBSD

INSTALL:

	- install tcl/tk
	- make sure tcl calls tcl?.? and wish calls wish?.?,
	  otherwise modify the TCLSH and WISH variables in ncid

    - The NCID package normally installs in /usr/local:
    - If a binary package is available:
        Copy ncid-VERSION.freebsd.tgz to the FreeBSD computer, then:
            tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION-freebsd.tgz -C /
            EXAMPLE: tar -xzvf ncid-0.64-freebsd.tgz -C /
    - install NCID package:
        - if there is no binary package, you need to compile the source:
        gmake freebsd (compiles for /usr/local, see top of Makefile)
        gmake install-freebsd

GMAKE NOTE:

    - The NCID source package requires gmake.

	- The optional GNU getopt is installed from /usr/ports/devel/libgnugetopt:
        cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
        make all install

CONFIGURE:

    - The default modem port in ncidd is /dev/modem.  This is just a
      symbolic link to the real modem port.
    - You should set the modem in ncidd.conf, if you are not using
      /dev/modem.  Use one of cuaa0, cuaa2, cuaa3, cuaa4 in /dev which
      corresponds to COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4
    - If you are using COM1 then you would add this line to ncidd.cinf:
        set modem = /dev/cuaa0

START:

    - If you are running the server and client on the same computer:
        ncidd
        ncid &

    - Call yourself and see if it works, if not, kill off ncidd, if
      it is running, and continue reading the test sections.

    - If everything is OK, run at boot: /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncidd
      so NCID can start when FreeBSD boots.

TEST USING A MODEM:

    - The easiest way to test the setup is to run ncidd in debug mode,
      it will stay attached to the terminal and not go into deamon mode:
        ncidd -D
      to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
      to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5

    - The last line should be: Modem set for CallerID.
    - If it says: ERROR
      try the CID strings in ncidd.conf or in doc/CID-init

    - Call yourself and you should see that the Caller ID lines.
    - If you only see RING for each ring, the modem does not support
      Caller ID.  You should see the Caller ID lines betreen the
      first and second RING.
    - If you see: /dev/ttyS1: No such file or directory
      you need to set sttyclocal in ncidd.conf

    - At any point, you can use command lines options to vary
      things like modem init and CID init.

    - Once it works, you would normally start it:
        ncidd

TEST USING NCIDSIP:

Start (in this order):
    ncidd
    ncidsip (may need to add options, review Setup-VOIP)
    ncid

    Call yourself

    if you have problems, start ncidd in debug mode:
        - ncidd -D
    to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5
    The last line should be: CallerID from CID client(s) only

    Once you solve any problems, restart ncidd normally

TEST USING A DEVICE (like the NetCallerID box):

    Start ncidd then ncid
    Call yourself

    if you have problems, start ncidd in debug mode:
        - ncidd -D
    to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5
    The Last line should be: CallerID TTY port initialized.

    Once you solve any problems, restart ncidd normally

GETOPT NOTE:

	- NCID will build as is.  It uses the included getopt_long(),

      If you would like to use the optional GNU getopt,
	  ncidd.h and getopt.c needs to have the __FreeBSD__
      removed and the following needs to be done:

	  The optional GNU getopt is installed from /usr/ports/devel/libgnugetopt:
        cd /usr/ports/devel/libgnugetopt
        make all install

	  The Makefile needs these two lines included for GNU getopt:
		MFLAGS = -I/usr/local/include
		LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib -lgnugetopt
