If NCID does not work, see INSTALL for some simple tests.
If using sip2ncid, see Setup-sip2ncid.

COMPILE:

    - See INSTALL

INSTALL:

	- install tcl/tk
	- make sure tcl calls tcl?.? and wish calls wish?.?,
	  otherwise modify the TCLSH and WISH variables in ncid

    - The NCID package normally installs in /usr/local:
    - If a binary package is available:
        Copy ncid-VERSION.freebsd.tgz to the FreeBSD computer, then:
            tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION-freebsd.tgz -C /
            EXAMPLE: tar -xzvf ncid-0.64-freebsd.tgz -C /
    - install NCID package:
        - if there is no binary package, you need to compile the source:
            Copy ncid-VERSION-src.tar.gz to the FreeBSD computer, then:
            tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION-src.tar.gz
            gmake freebsd (compiles for /usr/local, see top of Makefile)
            gmake freebsd-install

CONFIGURE:

    The ncidd.conf file is used to configure ncidd.

    - The default modem port in ncidd is /dev/modem.  This is just a
      symbolic link to the real modem port.
    - You should set the modem in ncidd.conf, if you are not using
      /dev/modem.  Use one of cuaa0, cuaa2, cuaa3, cuaa4 in /dev which
      corresponds to COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4
    - If you are using COM1 then you would add this line to ncidd.conf:
        set modem = /dev/cuaa0
    - If you are using a gateway instead of a local modem,
      you need to set noserial to 1:
        set noserial = 1
    - If you are using a local modem with or without a gateway:
        set noserial = 0  (this is the default)

STARTUP:

    - If you are running the server and client on the same computer
      and using a modem:
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncidd onestart
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a SIP gateway:
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/ncidd onestart
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/sip2ncid onestart
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a Whozz Calling gateway:
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/ncidd onestart
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/wc2ncid onestart
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a YAC gateway:
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/ncidd onestart
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/yac2ncid onestart
        ncid &

    - Call yourself and see if it works, if not, stop the gateway used:
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/sip2ncid onestop
      stop the server:
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.d/ncidd onestop
      and continue reading the test sections.

    - If everything is OK, enable the NCID server, gateways, and
      client modules you are using to autostart at boot:

    NOTE: ncid normally starts in the GUI mode and there is no
          ncid.rc script to start or stop it.  There are rc.d
          scripts for starting ncid with output modules, for
          example: ncid-page, ncid-kpopup, etc.

START/STOP/STATUS:

Use the /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncid* scripts to start any of the daemons.
The rc.d commands are: start, stop, restart, reload, and status.  The
client can also be started using the output module name instead of ncid.
All output modules can be run at the same time.

Here are examples:

    sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncidd start
    sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncidd reload
    sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/sip2ncid restart
    sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncid-speak stop
    sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncid-page status
    sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ncid-kpopup rcvar

If a service is not enabled, you must prefix 'one' to the commands;
start becomes onestart, stop becomes onestop, and so forth.

AUTOSTART:

    If you want NCID services to start automatically at boot, you need to
    add an enable line /etc/rc.conf.local for each service you want started.
    If /etc/rc.conf.local does not exist, create it.

    Here is the list of rc scripts and their enable lines:

        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/     /etc/rc.conf.local
        --------------------     ------------------
        ncidd                    ncidd_enable="YES"
        sip2ncid                 sip2ncid_enable="YES"
        yac2ncid                 yac2ncid_enable="YES"
        ncid-kpopup              ncidkpopup_enable="YES"
        ncid-notify              ncidnotify_enable="YES"
        ncid-page                ncidpage_enable="YES"
        ncid-samba               ncidsamba_enable="YES"
        ncid-skel                ncidskel_enable="YES"
        ncid-speak               ncidspeak_enable="YES"
        ncid-yac                 ncidyack_enable="YES"

TRIMMING LOG FILES:

FreeBSD uses newsyslog by default to trim files. To trim the
cidcall.log and the ciddata.log files, add this entry to
/etc/newsyslog.conf

    /var/log/cid*.log   root:wheel 644 5 * $M1D0 GN

GMAKE NOTE:

    - The NCID source package requires gmake.

	- The optional GNU getopt is installed from /usr/ports/devel/libgnugetopt:
        cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
        make all install
