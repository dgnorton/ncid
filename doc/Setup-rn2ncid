REQUIREMENT:

    The smart phone needs to be running Remote Notifier for Android from:
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.damazio.notifier&hl=en

    The android-notifier project is located at
    https://code.google.com/p/android-notifier/

    Install it and configure for the address of the computer running
    the NCID server.  You do not need to install the Remote Notifier client.

CONFIGURATION:

    The ncidd server defaults to using a modem to get Caller ID.  If
    you have a standard telephone line (POTS) modem configured, you
    you can keep the modem and use the rn2ncid gateway.


    If you do not use a modem and you are not using another gateway,
    you need to configure ncidd by changing one line in ncidd.conf.

        Change the line: # set noserial = 1
                 To: set noserial = 1

    This tells ncidd to run without a serial device or modem connected.
    Once you change ncidd.conf, you must start/restart ncidd to read it.

    Normally rn2ncid does not need to be configured unless you are using
    ncid-page or ncid-notify to send calls to your smart phone.  In that
    case you need to edit the reject line at the end of the rn2ncid.conf file.
    You need to put in the address for the ncidd server.  For example, if mail
    sends the message and the computer is mycomputer.dyndns.org:

    Edit rn2ncid.conf line: reject =

        Change the line: reject =
                 to: reject = mail@mycomputerr.dyndns.org

TESTING:

    If this is the first time you set rn2ncid up, you should test rn2ncid
    without connecting it to the ncidd server.

        rn2ncid --test

    The above command puts rn2ncid in test and debug modes at verbose level 3.
    It will display verbose statements on the terminal, ending with
    "Listening at port 10600".  It should show configured options.
    Test mode prevents rn2ncid from connecting with ncidd.

    If rn2ncid terminates you should be able to see why and fix it.

        print a detailed usage message: rn2ncid --help
        print the manual page:          rn2ncid --man

    On your smart phone bring up "Remote Notifier" and choose
    "Send test notification".  rn2ncid should show something like this:

        NOT: PHONE 0123: PING Test notification

    (Note: 0123 is the phone ID and will be different for your phone.)
    
    You may want to restart rn2ncid in debug mode so it will connect to ncidd:

        rn2ncid -Dv3

    Do the "Send test notification" again and it should be sent to the server
    and its clients.  If you do not get a "NOT" (short for "NOTIFY") message 
    sent to the server, you should instead get an error message saying what
    is wrong.

    If you had Caller ID sent to a client, setup is complete.

START/STOP/RESTART/STATUS/AUTOSTART:

    Normally rn2ncid is started using the provided init, service, rc, or
    plist script for your OS. For more information, refer to the INSTALL
    document for your OS.  If none is provided you need to start rn2ncid
    manually:

        sudo rn2ncid &

    You can also set it up to start at boot, along with ncidd.  If any options
    are needed, add them to /etc/ncid/rn2ncid.conf.

    If rn2ncid did not work, you should have enough information to ask for help.
