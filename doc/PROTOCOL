NCID Client and Server Protocol

The NCID-FORMAT file explains the lines sent to the client by the server.

To implement a client:
        - connect to port 3333.
        - receive a connect line that identifies the server
        - possibly receive multiple CIDLOG lines (only at connect)
        - possibly receive a server MSG line
        - possibly receive a CIDINFO line at each ring
        - receive a CID line whenever a call comes in
        - ignore lines that do not begin with:
          200
          CID:
          CIDLOG:
          MSG:
          MSGLOG:
          CIDINFO:
        - parse CID and CIDLOG lines based on name fields, so if fields
          is added, the old client will still work
        - clients are allowed to connect and disconnect as they please
        - clients are allowed to send a text message to the server

To implement a server:
        - listen to port 3333 for a connection,
        - send a connect line to identify the server
        - if configured, send CIDLOG and MSGLOG lines when a client connects
          these are the CID: and MSG: lines in cidcall.log
        - send a CID line when a call is received to connected clients
        - send a MSG line with important information, if needed
        - send a CIDINFO line at each ring with a line number (default 1)
          and the ring count
        - send a CIDINFO line after ringing stops, with a ring count of 0
        - maintain a constant TCP connection with the clients
        - detect clients as they come and go
        - if client sends text, sent it to all connected clients
