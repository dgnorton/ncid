Fedora Install

If NCID does not work, see INSTALL for some simple tests.
If using sip2ncid, see Setup-ncidsip
If using ncidsip, see Setup-ncidsip

COMPILE:

    The following packages are required:
    - sudo yum install libpcap-devel

    See INSTALL for compile instructions

INSTALL or UPGRADE:

    NCID requires the server and client RPM packages to function.  The
    server is required on one computer or device, but the client can be
    installed on as many computers as needed.

    The client has a few output modules in its RPM package, and there
    are optional output modules in their own RPM packages.

    - Download server and client RPM Packages from Fedora repositories
          ncid RPM Package         - server and gateways
          ncid-client RPM Package  - client and default output modules

    - Download any optional output modules wanted:
          ncid-MODULE RPM Package  - optional client output modules

    - Install or Upgrade the packages:
        Using the file viewer:
            - Open the file viewer to view the NCID RPM packages
            - Select the RPM packages
            - right click selections and select "Open with Package installer"
        Using YUM:
            - sudo yum install ncid*.rpm

CONFIGURE:

    The ncidd.conf file is used to configure ncidd.

    - The default modem port in ncidd is /dev/modem.  This is just a
      symbolic link to the real modem port. It is probably best to
      set your modem port in ncidd.conf.  This assumes serial port 1:
        set ttyport = /dev/ttyS0
    - If you are using a SIP or YAC gateway instead of a local modem,
      you need to set noserial to 1:
        set noserial = 1
    - If you are using a local modem with or without a SIP or YAC gateway:
        set noserial = 0  (this is the default)

STARTUP:

    - if you are running the server and client on the same computer
      and using a modem:
        sudo service ncidd start
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a SIP gateway:
        sudo service ncidd start
        sudo service sip2ncid start
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a YAC gateway:
        sudo service ncidd start
        sudo service yac2ncid start
        ncid &

    - Call yourself and see if it works, if not, stop the gateway used:
        sudo service sip2ncid stop
      stop the server:
        sudo service ncidd stop
      and continue reading the test sections.

    - If everything is OK, enable the NCID server, gateways, and
      client modules, your are using, to autostart at boot.  The
      GUI ncid client must be started after login, not boot.

    NOTE: ncid normally starts in the GUI mode and there is no
          ncid.init script to start or stop it.  There are rc.init
          scripts for starting ncid with output modules, for
          example: ncid-page, ncid-kpopup, etc.

START/STOP/STATUS:

    Use the service command to start any of the daemons.  The service
    commands are: start, stop, restart, reload, and status.  The client
    can also be started using the output module name instead of ncid.
    All output modules can be run at the same time.

    Here are some examples:
    - start the NCID server: sudo service ncidd start
    - stop the ncid2sip server: sudo service sip2ncid stop
    - reload the server alias file: sudo service ncidd reload
    - start ncid with ncid-page: sudo service ncid-page start
    - get the status of ncid with ncid-speak: sudo service ncid-speak status

    Review the man page (man service).

AUTOSTART:

    Use the chkconfig command to configure/remove the service to start at boot.

    Here are some examples:
    - autostart ncidd at boot: sudo chkconfig ncidd on
    - autostart ncid-page at boot: sudo chkconfig ncid-page on
    - autostart ncid-kpopup at boot: sudo chkconfig ncid-kpopup on
    - list runlevels for sip2ncid: sudo chkconfig --list sip2ncid
    - remove ncid-speak from starting at boot: sudo chkconfig ncid-speak off

    Review the manpage (man chkconfig).
