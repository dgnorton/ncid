Fedora Install

If NCID does not work, see INSTALL for some simple tests.

INSTALL:

    - Download the latest NCID rpm package from sourceforge
    - Open the file viewer to view the NCID rpm package
    - Install the NCID rpm package by double clicking on it.

    If you want to use ncidsip:

    - Use "Add/Remove Software" to install "perl-IO-Interface"
    - Download, compile, and install the Net-Pcap module

CONFIGURE:

    - The default modem port in ncidd is /dev/modem.  This is just a
      symbolic link to the real modem port. It is probably best to
      set your modem port in ncidd.conf.  This assumes serial port 1:
        set ttyport = /dev/ttyS0
    - If you are using sip2ncid or yac2ncid instead of a modem
      you need to set noserial to 1:
        set noserial = 1

STARTUP:

    - if you are running the server and client on the same computer
      and using a modem:
        sudo service ncidd start
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a SIP gateway:
        sudo service ncidd start
        sudo service sip2ncid start
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a YAC gateway:
        sudo service ncidd start
        sudo service yac2ncid start
        ncid &

    - Call yourself and see if it works, if not, stop the gateway used:
        sudo service sip2ncid stop
      stop the server:
        sudo service ncidd stop
      and continue reading the test sections.

    - If everything is OK, enable the NCID server, gateways, and
      client modules, your are using, to autostart at boot.  The
      GUI incid client must be started after login, not boot.

    NOTE: ncid normally starts in the GUI mode and there is no
          ncid.init script to start or stop it.  There are rc.init
          scripts for starting ncid with output modules, for
          example: ncid-page, ncid-popup, etc.

START/STOP/STATUS:

    Use the service command to start any of the daemons.  The service
    commands are: start, stop, restart, reload, and status.  The client
    can also be started using the output module name instead of ncid.
    All output modules can be run at the same time.

    Here are some examples:
    - start the NCID server: sudo service ncidd start
    - stop the ncid2sip server: sudo service sip2ncid stop
    - reload the server alias file: sudo service ncidd reload
    - start ncid with ncid-page: sudo service ncid-page start
    - get the status of ncid with ncid-speak: sudo service ncid-speak status

    Review the man page (man service).

AUTOSTART:

    Use the chkconfig command to configure/remove the service to start at boot.

    Here are some examples:
    - autostart ncidd at boot: sudo chkconfig ncidd on
    - autostart ncid-page at boot: sudo chkconfig ncid-page on
    - autostart ncid-popup at boot: sudo chkconfig ncid-popup on
    - list runlevels for sip2ncid: sudo chkconfig --list sip2ncid
    - remove ncid-speak from starting at boot: sudo chkconfig ncid-speak off

    Review the manpage (man chkconfig).
