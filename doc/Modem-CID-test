# Modem CID test
# Thu May 23, 2006

Start ncidd in test mode and verbose level 3:
You do not need to start any client.

    ncidd -Dv3

You should see something simular to (the important part is the last line):

  Started: 05/18/2006 20:27
  Server: ncidd 0.64
  Configured to send 'cidlog' to clients.
  Configured to send 'cidinfo' to clients.
  Processed config file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.conf
  Processed alias file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.alias
  Verbose level: 3
  CID logfile: /var/log/cidcall.log
  Data logfile: /var/log/ciddata.log
  TTY port opened: /dev/ttyS0
  TTY port speed: 19200
  TTY lock file: /var/lock/LCK..ttyS0
  TTY port control signals enabled
  AT Z S0=0 E1 V1 Q0^M^M

  Try 1 to init modem: return = 0.
  Modem initialized.
  AT+VCID=1^M^M
  ERROR
  AT#CID=1^M^M
  OK
  Modem set for CallerID.
  
Next, call yourself, and you should see something like:

  RING
  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*1*
  DATE = 0518
  TIME = 2036
  NMBR = 14075551212
  NAME = Jesse James
  CID: *DATE*05182006*TIME*2036*LINE*-*NMBR*14075551212*MESG*NONE*NAME*Jesse James*
  RING
  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*2*
  RING
  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*3*
  
Hangup the phone, and a second or two later:

  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*0*

Do a <CTRL C> to break out and end the test:

  Terminated  05/18/2006 20:36

However, if your modem does not support CID  or you are using a modem
that needs to be configured for the CID system it is on,you will see
something like:

  RING
  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*1*
  RING
  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*2*
  RING
  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*3*
  
Hangup the phone and a second or two later

  CIDINFO: *LINE*-*RING*0*

Do a <CTRL C> to break out and end the test.

  Terminated  05/18/2006 20:36
