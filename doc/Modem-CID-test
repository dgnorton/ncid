# Modem CID test
# Thu Aug 11, 2005

Start ncidd in test mode and verbose level 2:

    ncidd -Dv2

You should see something simular to (the important part is the last line):

    Configured to send 'cidlog' to clients.
    Configured to send 'cidinfo' to clients.
    Processed config file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.conf
    Processed alias file: /etc/ncid/ncidd.alias
    CID logfile: /var/log/cidcall.log
    Data logfile: /var/log/ciddata.log
    TTY port opened: /dev/ttyS0
    TTY port speed: 19200
    TTY lock file: /var/lock/LCK..ttyS0
    Modem control signals enabled
    AT Z S0=0 E1 V1 Q0
    OK
    Modem initialized.
    AT+VCID=1
    OK
    Modem set for CallerID.

Next, call yourself, and you should see something like:

    RING        (this is the 1st ring)

    DATE = 1105
    TIME = 2106
    NMBR = 9495551212
    NAME = Jesse James

    RING    (this is the 2nd ring)

    RING    (hangup at this point)

However, if your modem does not support CID you will see something like:

    RING

    RING

    RING    (hangup at this point)

Do a <CTRL C> to break out and end the test.
