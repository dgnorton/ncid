ncid - Network CallerID Cygwin Install

NOTES:
    The server has been tested with ncidsip running on a Linux
    system.

    - The server does not function with a modem so it is configured
      for "noserial".  It requires ncidsip to function.
    - The supplied ncidsip client requires perl and the Net-Pcap module
      http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/S/SA/SAPER/Net-Pcap-0.12/Pcap.tar.gz
    - Net-Pcap requires WinPcap: http://www.winpcap.org/
    - The Net-Pcap module has not been successfully built under cygwin

INSTALL:

	Install Cygwin from http://cygwin.com/
		- download setup.exe into a empty folder
        - Run setup.exe
        - select a download site
        - Look at the Perl catagory and set to install Perl
        - Let setup download and install cygwin

	Install ncid:
        - The NCID package normally installs in /usr/local:
        - If a binary package is available:
            Copy ncid-VERSION-cygwin.tgz to cygwin, then:
                tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION-cygwin.tgz -C /
                EXAMPLE: tar -xzvf ncid-0.64-cygwin.tgz -C /
        - if there is no binary package, you need to compile the source:
            Copy ncid-VERSION.tar.gz
            cd ncid
            make cygwin (compiles for /usr/local, see top of Makefile)
            make install-cygwin

CONFIGURE:

    The Makefile preconfigures ncidd.conf for the Cygwin, but you may
    want to change some of the defaults.

START:

    - start the server and client:
        ncidd
        ncid &
    - Call yourself and see if it works.

TEST:

    - The easiest way to test the setup is to run ncidd in debug mode,
      it will stay attached to the terminal and not go into deamon mode:
		ncidd -D
    - to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    - to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5

    - The last line should be: Modem set for CallerID.
    - If it says: ERROR
      try the CID strings in ncidd.conf or in doc/CID-init

    - Call yourself and you should see the CallerID lines.
    - If you only see RING for each ring, the modem does not support
      Caller ID.  You should see the Caller ID lines betreen the
      first and second RING.
    - If you see: /dev/ttyS0: No such file or directory
      you need to set sttyclocal in ncidd.conf

    - At any point, you can use command lines options to vary
      things like modem init and CID init.

	- Once it works, you would normally start it:
        ncidd
