ncid - Network CallerID Cygwin Install

NOTES:
    The server has been tested with ncidsip running on a Linux
    system.

    - The server does not function with a modem so it is configured
      for "noserial".  It requires ncidsip to function.
    - The supplied ncidsip client requires perl and the Net-Pcap module
      http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/S/SA/SAPER/Net-Pcap-0.12/Pcap.tar.gz
    - Net-Pcap requires WinPcap: http://www.winpcap.org/
    - The Net-Pcap module has been successfully built under cygwin

INSTALL:

	Install Cygwin from http://cygwin.com/
		- download setup.exe into a empty folder
        - Run setup.exe
        - select download site sites
        - Look at the Perl catagory and set to install Perl
        - Let setup download and install cygwin
        ------------------------------------------------
        If phone system is VoIP and you want to use SIP:
        ------------------------------------------------
        - install a development system using gcc and install cpan
        - install WinPcap at C:\ from http://www.winpcap.org/
        - run "cpan" and it will configure itself, accept defaults
          to questions asked, but select multiple download sites
        - At the "cpan>" prompt, type: install IO::Interface
          (if it fails, fix problem and try: cpan -r)
        - At the "cpan>" prompt type: cpan install Net::Pcap
          It will fail.  Quit cpan and go to .cpan/build and do
          a ls.  You will see the Net-Pcap-xxx directory.  Cd into
          it and type "make"  when it fails, the error message will
          tell you what the command line should be for WinPcap installed
          at C:\.  After you make it, type: make install

	Install ncid:
        - The NCID package normally installs in /usr/local:
        - If a binary package is available:
            Copy ncid-VERSION-cygwin.tgz to cygwin, then:
                tar -xzvf ncid-VERSION-cygwin.tgz -C /
                EXAMPLE: tar -xzvf ncid-0.64-cygwin.tgz -C /
        - if there is no binary package, you need to compile the source:
            Copy ncid-VERSION.tar.gz
            cd ncid
            make cygwin (compiles for /usr/local, see top of Makefile)
            make install-cygwin

CONFIGURE:

    The Makefile preconfigures ncidd.conf for the Cygwin, but you may
    want to change some of the defaults.

    You need to configure ncidsip to use the Network Interface.
    To find out the network intercafe name, you need to make iflist.
    cd to C:/WpdPack/Examples-pcap/iflist and type: make
    You should see your Network interface names listed.  Select the
    active one and use it with the -i option to ncidsip.

START:

    - If this is your first time, you should do the TEST procedure first

    - start the server and clients:
        ncidd
        ncidsip -l (list NETWORK_INTERFACES)
        ncidsip -i NETWORK_INTERFACE &
        ncid &
    - Call yourself and see if it works.

TEST:
    - You need to test your local network for SIP packets.
      Follow the instructions in Setup-VOIP.  Once you configure
      your network, if needed, and know what options to give to
      ncidsip, you are ready to set up NCID.

    - The easiest way to test the setup is to run ncidd in debug mode,
      it will stay attached to the terminal and not go into deamon mode:
		ncidd -D
    - to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    - to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5
    - The last line should be: CallerID from CID client(s) only

    - Start ncidsip using options determined from the Setup-VOIP procedure:
        ncidsip -i NETWORK_INTERFACE [other options]

    - Call yourself and you should see the CallerID lines.
    - If you only see RING for each ring, the modem does not support
      Caller ID.  You should see the Caller ID lines betreen the
      first and second RING.
    - If you see: /dev/ttyS0: No such file or directory
      you need to set sttyclocal in ncidd.conf

    - At any point, you can use command lines options to vary
      things like modem init and CID init.

	- Once it works, you would normally start it:
        ncidd
