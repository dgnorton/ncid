Windows Install

Last edited: Mon Jun 22, 2009

Install either the windows client package or the complete package.

WINDOWS CLIENT INSTALL:

    Install this package if you only need the client.

	- Execute the ncid installer: ncid-?.?-setup.exe
      where ?.? is the version number, for example: ncid-0.62-setup.exe
    - Configure ncid in the configure screen.  The default address is
      127.0.0.1, so you will need to change it to the address of your
      ncid server, for example: "ncid.sourceforge.net" or "192.168.22.10"
    - The installer will not auto start ncid at login, you can create
      a link in the start menu if you like.  See below for configuring
      the link.

WINDOWS COMPLETE COMPILE:

    See INSTALL, INSTALL-Cygwin, and INSTALL-andLinux

WINDOWS COMPLETE INSTALL:

    Install andLinux or Cygwin if you need to install the complete
    NCID package, including server, client, and gateways.

    The serial port functions of ncidd do not work under Windows or
    Cygwin so you must use the SIP or YAC gateway with it.  It is
    unknown if a modem will work under andLinux so it is best to
    use a gateway with it also.

    NCID under Cygwin is a fairly complex command line install, and there
    are some performance issues with it.  It is recommended you use andLinux.
    See INSTALL-Cygwin if you want to install Cygwin and NCID.

    NCID under andLinux is a easy install.  It is based on Ubuntu and
    can use the GUI based package manager to install/update/remove it.
    See INSTALL-andLinux if you want to install andLinux and NCID.

NCID.TCL INSTALL:

	Use this method only if you want to run ncid.tcl instead of ncid.exe
	This was the original install method.  You need to get ncid.tcl from
    the source package.

	Download the tcl/tk interpreter:
		- http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActiveTcl/
		- click on download
		- click on next
		- click on ActiveTcl ?.?.?.? Self-extracting AS Package

	Install tcl/tk:
		- Run the file downloaded: ActiveTcl?.?.?.?-win32-ix86.exe

	Install ncid:
		- Unzip ncid-0.?.zip to c:\ or any location you prefer
		  it will add a directory called ncid with files in it.
		- Create a shortcut on the desktop to ncid.tcl, for example:
			c:\ncid\ncid.tcl
		- If the server is not on the same computer, open the
		  shortcut properties and include the IP address (or the
		  DNS name) with the program name in "Target:" field.

		  for example, if Target has:	C:\ncid
		  add IP address:	C:\ncid 192.168.0.1

		  or, if path, in Target has spaces: E:\Program Files\ncid
		  add quotes around path, then add the IP address or DNS name:
		  	"E:\Program Files\ncid" 192.168.0.1
