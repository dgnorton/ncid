ncid - Network CallerID Client Install

Last edited: Sun Sep 23, 2007

INSTALL:

	- Execute the ncid installer: ncid-?.?-setup.exe
      where ?.? is the version number, for example: ncid-0.62-setup.exe
    - Configure ncid in the configure screen.  The default address is
      127.0.0.1, so you will need to change it to the address of your
      ncid server, for example: ncid.sourceforge.net
    - The installer will not auto start ncid at login, you can create
      a link in the start menu if you like.  See below for configuring
      the link.

TEST:

	Start ncid and ncidd
	Call yourself

	if you have problems, start ncidd in debug mode:
		ncidd -D
    to get more information, add the verbose flag:
        ncidd -Dv3
    to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv5

NCID - Network Caller ID Install

Linux:
The Makefile assumes a Redhat Linux environment
	The programs go into $prefix/bin $prefix/sbin
	The config file goes into $prefix2/etc
	The init script goes into $prefix2/etc/rc.d/init.d
	The modem link or driver is expected in /dev
	The LOG file is expected in /var/log
	The man pages go into $MAN, which is $prefix/share/man
	The default is prefix=/usr/local, prefix2=$prefix

Compile:

	To configure programs and config file for /usr/local:
		- make local

	To configure for programs for /usr, and the config file for /etc:
		- make package

	To cross-compile for the TiVo:
		- make tivo-series1 (requires TiVo cross-development:
          /usr/local/tivo)
		- make tivo-series2 (requires TiVo cross-development:
          /usr/local/mips-tivo)

INSTALL:

	To install in /usr/local (man pages go into /usr/local/share/man):
		- make install

	To install in /usr/local (man pages go into /usr/local/man):
		- make install MAN=/usr/local/man

	To install programs in /usr, config file in /etc,
		and man pages in /usr/share/man:
		- make install prefix=/usr prefix2=

    Note: The install target installs files into /etc/logrotate.d
          and /etc/rc.d/init.d.  If you do not have these directories
          use install-base instead of install in the above.

          See the top of the Makefile for more information on targets.

TEST:

	Start ncid and ncidd
	Call yourself

	if you have problems, start ncidd in debug mode:
		- ncidd -D

    if ncidd aborts when you call yourself with something like:
        Modem set for CallerID.
        Modem Error Condition. (Phone rang here)
        /dev/ttyS1: No such file or directory
    You need to set ncidd to ignore modem signals.
    Uncomment the following line in ncidd.conf:
        # set sttyclocal = 1

    If you only see RING for each ring, the modem does not support
    Caller ID.  You should see the Caller ID lines betreen the
    first and second RING.

	Once you solve the problems, restart ncidd normally
        ncidd -Dv2
    to also look at the alias structure
        ncidd -Dv3
	Once you solve the problem, restart ncidd normally


NCID.TCL INSTALL:

	Use this method only if you want to run ncid.tcl instead of ncid.exe
	This was the original install method.  You need to get ncid.tcl from
    the source package.

	Download the tcl/tk interpreter:
		- http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActiveTcl/
		- click on download
		- click on next
		- click on ActiveTcl ?.?.?.? Self-extracting AS Package

	Install tcl/tk:
		- Run the file downloaded: ActiveTcl?.?.?.?-win32-ix86.exe

	Install ncid:
		- Unzip ncid-0.?.zip to c:\ or any location you prefer
		  it will add a directory called ncid with files in it.
		- Create a shortcut on the desktop to ncid.tcl, for example:
			c:\ncid\ncid.tcl
		- If the server is not on the same computer, open the
		  shortcut properties and include the IP address (or the
		  DNS name) with the program name in "Target:" field.

		  for example, if Target has:	C:\ncid
		  add IP address:	C:\ncid 192.168.0.1

		  or, if path, in Target has spaces: E:\Program Files\ncid
		  add quotes around path, then add the IP address or DNS name:
		  	"E:\Program Files\ncid" 192.168.0.1
