Ubuntu Install

If NCID does not work, see INSTALL for some simple tests.

INSTALL:

    - Download the latest NCID deb package from sourceforge
    - Use the the menu item "Add/Remove.." to download GDebi Package Installer.
    - Open the file viewer (Places->Home Folder) to view the NCID deb package
    - Install the NCID deb package by double clicking on it.

    If you want to use ncidsip:

    - Download, compile, and install the IO-Interface module from CPAN
    - Download, compile, and install the Net-Pcap module from CPAN

CONFIGURE:

    - The default modem port in ncidd is /dev/modem.  This is just a
      symbolic link to the real modem port. It is probably best to
      set your modem port in ncidd.conf.  This assumes serial port 1:
        set ttyport = /dev/ttyS0
    - If you are using sip2ncid or yac2ncid instead of a modem
      you need to set noserial to 1:
        set noserial = 1

FIRST STARTUP:

    - if you are running the server and client on the same computer
      and using a modem:
        sudo invoke-rc.d ncidd start
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a SIP gateway:
        sudo invoke-rc.d ncidd start
        sudo invoke-rc.d sip2ncid start
        ncid &

    - If you are running the server and using a YAC gateway:
        sudo invoke-rc.d ncidd start
        sudo invoke-rc.d yac2ncid start
        ncid &

    - Call yourself and see if it works, if not, stop the gateway used:
        sudo invoke-rc.d sip2ncid stop
      stop the server:
        sudo invoke-rc.d ncidd stop
      and continue reading the test sections.

    - If everything is OK, enable the NCID server, gateways, and
      client modules, your are using, to autostart at boot.  The
      GUI incid client must be started after login, not boot

    NOTE: ncid normally starts in the GUI mode and there is no
          ncid.init script to start or stop it.  There are rc.init
          scripts for starting ncid with output modules, for
          example: ncid-page, ncid-popup, etc.

START/STOP/STATUS:

    Use the invoke-rc.d command to start any of the daemons.  The invoke-rc.d
    commands are: start, stop, restart, reload, and status.  The client
    can also be started using the output module name instead of ncid.
    All output modules can be run at the same time.

    Here are some examples:
    - start the NCID server: sudo invoke-rc.d ncidd start
    - stop the ncid2sip server: sudo invoke-rc.d sip2ncid stop
    - reload the server alias file: sudo invoke-rc.d ncidd reload
    - start ncid with ncid-page: sudo invoke-rc.d ncid-page start
    - status of ncid with ncid-speak: sudo invoke-rc.d ncid-speak status

    Review the man page (man invoke-rc.d).

AUTOSTART:

    Use the update-rc.d command to install/remove the service at boot.

    Here are some examples:
    - start ncidd at boot: sudo update-rc.d ncidd defaults
    - start ncid-page at boot: sudo update-rc.d ncid-page defaults
    - remove ncidsip form starting at boot: sudo update-rc.d -f ncidsip remove

    Review the man page (man update-rc.d).
