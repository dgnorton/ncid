===============================================================
These are the test programs and test files for the NCID server,
clients, and client output modules.
===============================================================

    If you haven't built up ncidd(server) and ncid(client),
    do it now to be able to perform the following tests.

aliasfile:
    Used to view the cidalias array in the server.  Called
    from the ncidd-noerrors.conf file.

aliasfile.errors:
    Various alias file errors: ncidd -DA aliasfile.errors

largecall.log:
    This call Logfile contains 3006 simular lines.  It is used to detect
    any dropping of characters by the client or server.

ncidd-errors.conf:
    Server configuration file with errors: ncidd -DC ncidd-errors.conf

ncidd-noerrors.conf:
    Server configuration file with no errors.  It reads the aliasfile.
    ncidd -Dv5 -C ncidd-noerrors.conf

test-client:
test-client.data:
test-client-screenshot.data:
    The program test-client is an NCID server emulator.  It is used to
    test a client. The test server uses port 3334.  It sends one or more
    lines from the test-client.data file with each press of <ENTER>.
    The last <ENTER> will terminate the server.  Blank lines are used to
    terminate a send initiated by <ENTER>.

    Usage: ./test-client [data_file]
    Default Data File: test-client.data
    Alternate File:    test-client-screenshot.data:

    To test a client:
	    Start test-client (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	    Start the NCID client on port 3334 (it will receive the 200 line)
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 MSG line
	    Press <ENTER> to send 5 CIDLOG lines
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 MSG line
	    Press <ENTER> to send a CID line (there are 2 CID lines)
	    Press <ENTER> to send various combinations of CID and CIDINFO lines
                      (there a 8 CID and CIDINFO line combinations)
	    Press <ENTER> to send a CID line with a specific number of digits
                      (there are 7 CID lines)
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 CIDINFO RING line
	    Press <ENTER> to end test-client

    NOTE: test-client and test-client.data must be in the same directory

testlog:
testlog-display:
    Testlog contains test data that is sent to clients at start.
    It is used as the cidcall.log file.

    Testlog-display is how ncid will display testlog.
    This assumes the "1" digit is not configured to display.
    This also assumes the display format is for the US.

test-script.data:
    A test file for ncid output modules, like ncid-page and ncid-speak.
    To test ncid-page: cat test-script.data | ncid-page

    Output modules can be tested buy supplying 5 lines of input.
    The input lines are not error checked.  They are:
        Date
        Time
        Number
        Name
        Line Label

test-server:
    This program is used to test ncidd or a client.  The server is
    optioned for verbose level 3, port 3334 and either debug mode
    or Mac OSX launchd mode.  The test server can be run at the same
    time as one in actual use.

    The test-server script creates empty T-data.log and T-alias files
    in the current directory.  It also creates T-conf, T-blacklist,
    and T-whitelist files with test data.  When ncidd is launched, it
    creates T-logfile, T-pid, T-call.log files and will populate them
    with data.  Most T-* files can be modified for test-client after
    they have been created.  The T-* files can be deleted by hand or
    "make clobber" when testing is finished.

    Usage: test-server {<path>/ncidd} {-D|--osx-launchd} [<ncidd_option(s)>]

    Examples: # Run test server in modem mode with verbose level 4:
              # must use with test-modem-calls
              ./test-server ../server/ncidd -D -v4

              # Run test server with a Linux USB modem
              ./test-server ../server/ncidd -D -t /dev/ttyACM0

              # Run test-server in launchd mode and noserial (gateway mode)
              ./test-server ../server/ncidd --osx-launchd -N1

test-sip-gw:
test-sip-gw.data:
    This program emulates a SIP server for testing a SIP gateway.
    Usage: ./test-sip-gw [data_file]
    Default Data File: test-sip-gw.data

    To test a SIP gateway:
        Start test-sip2ncid (it will give instructions for sip2ncid)
        Start the SIP gateway on port 3334
        Press <ENTER> to send the first SIP packet
        Press <ENTER> to keep sending packets until program terminates

    NOTE: test-sip-gw and test-sip-gw.data must be in the same directory

test-gw-calls:
test-gw-calls.data:
test-gw-calls-screenshot.data:
    This program emulates the output from a gateway.  It is usually
    run at the same time as test-server and ncid.
    Usage: ./test-gw-calls [data_file]
    Default Data File: test-gw-calls.data
    Alternate File:    test-gw-calls-screenshot.data

    To test a server or client, start all three programs in 3 different
    terminal windows in this order:
        ./test-server ../server/ncidd -D -N1
        ./test-gw-calls
        ../client/ncid 3334

    Press <ENTER> to send the first line
    Press <ENTER> to keep sending lines until program terminates

    NOTE: test-gw-calls and test-gw-calls.data must be in the same directory

test-modem-calls:
test-modem-calls.data:
    This program simulates the output of a modem.  It is usually
    run at the same time as test-server and ncid.

    To test a server or client, start all three programs in 3 different
    terminal windows in this order:
        ./test-modem-calls
        ./test-server ../server/ncidd -D
        ../client/ncid 3334

    Press <ENTER> to send the first line
    Press <ENTER> to keep sending lines until program terminates

    NOTE: test-modem-calls and test-modem-calls.data must be in the
          same directory

test-rn2ncid:
test-rn2ncid.data:
    This program emulates the output from the rn2ncid (Remote Notifier
    for Android) gateway.  It is usually run at the same time as 
    test-server and ncid.
    Usage: ./test-rn2ncid [data_file]
    Default Data File: test-rn2ncid.data

    To test a server or client, start all four programs in 4 different
    terminal windows in this order:
        ./test-server ../server/ncidd -D -N1
        ./test-rn2ncid
        ../client/ncid 3334
        ../gateway/rn2ncid -n localhost:3334 -c 10600 -D

    Press <ENTER> to send the first line
    Press <ENTER> to keep sending lines until program terminates

    NOTE: test-rn2ncid and test-rn2ncid.data must be in the same directory
