The files in this directory are used as follows:
------------------------------------------------

aliasfile:
    Used to test "cidalias".

ncidd-errors.conf:
ncidd-noerrors.conf:
    Used to test the configuration of ncidd.  Neither config
    file will permit ncidd to run after the config file is read.

testclient:
testclient.data:
    The program is a NCID test server used to send various NCID
    lines to test a client.  The test server uses port 3334.  It
    sends one or more lines from the testclient.data file with each
    press of <ENTER>.  The last <ENTER> will terminate the server.
    Blank lines are used to terminate a send initiated by <ENTER>.

    To test a client:
	    Start testclient (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	    Start the NCID client on port 3334 (it will receive the 200 line)
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 MSG line
	    Press <ENTER> to send 5 CIDLOG lines
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 MSG line
	    Press <ENTER> to send a CID line (there are 2 CID lines)
	    Press <ENTER> to send various combinations of CID and CIDINFO lines
                      (there a 8 CID and CIDINFO line combinations)
	    Press <ENTER> to send a CID line with a specific number of digits
                      (there are 7 CID lines)
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 CIDINFO RING line
	    Press <ENTER> to end testclient

	    Usage: testclient [datafile]
	    Default Data File: testclient.data

	    NOTE: testclient and testclient.data must be in the same directory

testlog:
testlog-display:
    Testlog contains test data that is sent to clients at start.
    It is used as the cidcall.log file.

    Testlog-display is how ncid will display testlog.
    This assumes the "1" digit is not configured to display.
    This also assumes the display format is for the US.

testscript.data:
    A test file for ncid output modules, like ncid-page and ncid-speak.
    To test ncid-page: cat testscript.data | ncidpage

testserver:
    This program is used to test ncidd or a client.  The server is
    optioned for "noserial" mode, verbose level 3, and port 3334.
    The test server can be run at the same time as one in actual use.

    It will create needed empty files that have a name that start with
    "T-".  The config and alias files can be populated.  All "T-*"
    files can be removed when testing is finished.

    Usage: testserver {FULLY_QUALIFIED_PATH/ncidd} [-nciddOption(s)]

    Examples: #run the test server in verbose level 4:
              ./testserver /usr/sbin/ncidd -v4

              # Run testserver in debug mode:
              ./testserver /usr/sbin/ncidd -D

TestGWcalls:
TestGWcalls.data:
    This program emulates the output from a gateway.  It is usually
    run at the same time as testserver and ncid

    To test a server or client, start all three programs in 3 different
    terminal windows:
        ./testserver ../ncidd -D
        ./TestGWcalls
        ./ncid

    Press <ENTER> to send the first line
    Press <ENTER> to keep sending lines until program terminates
