===============================================================
These are the test programs and test files for the NCID server,
clients, and client output modules.
===============================================================

aliasfile:
    Used to view the cidalias array in the server.  Called
    from the ncidd-noerrors.conf file.

aliasfile.errors:
    Various alias file errors: ncidd -DA aliasfile.errors:

client-screenshot.data:
    used with testclient for taking client screenshots

    Usage: ./testclient client-screenshot.data

	Start testclient (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	Start the NCID client on port 3334 (it will receive the 200 line)
	Press <ENTER> to send OUT line (outgoing call)
	Press <ENTER> to send HUP line (auto hangup call)
	Press <ENTER> to send CID line (incoming call)
	Press <ENTER> to send MSG line (received message)
	Press <ENTER> to end testclient

largelog:
    Logfile contains 3006 simular lines.  It is used to detect
    any dropping of characters by the client or server.

ncidd-errors.conf:
    Server configuration file with errors: ncidd -DC ncidd-errors.conf

ncidd-noerrors.conf:
    Server configuration file with no errors.  It reads the aliasfile.
    ncidd -Dv5 -C ncidd-noerrors.conf

testclient:
testclient.data:
    The program is a NCID server emulator.  It is used  to test a client.
    The test server uses port 3334.  It sends one or more lines from the
    testclient.data file with each press of <ENTER>.  The last <ENTER>
    will terminate the server.  Blank lines are used to terminate a send
    initiated by <ENTER>.

    Usage:             ./testclient [data_file]
	Default Data File: testclient.data

    To test a client:
	    Start testclient (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	    Start the NCID client on port 3334 (it will receive the 200 line)
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 MSG line
	    Press <ENTER> to send 5 CIDLOG lines
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 MSG line
	    Press <ENTER> to send a CID line (there are 2 CID lines)
	    Press <ENTER> to send various combinations of CID and CIDINFO lines
                      (there a 8 CID and CIDINFO line combinations)
	    Press <ENTER> to send a CID line with a specific number of digits
                      (there are 7 CID lines)
	    Press <ENTER> to send 1 CIDINFO RING line
	    Press <ENTER> to end testclient

	    NOTE: testclient and testclient.data must be in the same directory

testlog:
testlog-display:
    Testlog contains test data that is sent to clients at start.
    It is used as the cidcall.log file.

    Testlog-display is how ncid will display testlog.
    This assumes the "1" digit is not configured to display.
    This also assumes the display format is for the US.

testscript.data:
    A test file for ncid output modules, like ncid-page and ncid-speak.
    To test ncid-page: cat testscript.data | ncidpage

    Output modules can be tested buy supplying 5 lines of input.
    The input lines are not error checked.  They are:
        Date
        Time
        Number
        Name
        Line Label

    As an example, to check ncid-initmodem:
        sh -x /usr/share/ncid/ncid-initmodem
            d
            t
            RING
            n
            l

testserver:
    This program is used to test ncidd or a client.  The server is
    optioned for verbose level 3, port 3334 and either debug mode
    or Mac OSX launchd mode.  The test server can be run at the same
    time as one in actual use.

    The testserver script creates empty T-data.log and T-alias files
    in the current directory.  It also creates T-conf, T-blacklist,
    and T-whitelist files with test data.  When ncidd is launched, it
    creates T-logfile, T-pid, T-call.log files and will populate them
    with data.  Most T-* files can be modified for testclient after
    they have been created.  The T-* files can be by hand or "make clobber"
    when testing is finished.

    Usage: testserver {<path>/ncidd} {-D|--osx-launchd} [<ncidd_option(s)>]

    Examples: # Run test server in modem mode with verbose level 4:
              # must use with TestMdmcalls
              ./testserver ../server/ncidd -D -v4

              # Run test server with a Linux USB modem
              ./testserver ../server/ncidd -D -t /dev/ttyACM0

              # Run testserver in launchd mode and noserial (gateway mode)
              ./testserver ../server/ncidd --osx-launchd -N1

TestGWcalls:
TestGWcalls.data:
TestGWcalls-screenshot.data
    This program emulates the output from a gateway.  It is usually
    run at the same time as testserver and ncid.
    Usage:             ./TestGWcalls [data_file]
	Default Data File: TestGWcalls.data
    Alternate File:    TestGWcalls-screenshot.data

    To test a server or client, start all three programs in 3 different
    terminal windows in this order:
        ./testserver ../server/ncidd -N1
        ./TestGWcalls
        ./ncid 3334

    Press <ENTER> to send the first line
    Press <ENTER> to keep sending lines until program terminates

TestMdmcalls:
TestMdmcalls.data:
    This program simulates the output of a modem.  It is usually
    run at the same time as testserver and ncid.

    To test a server or client, start all three programs in 3 different
    terminal windows in this order:
        ./TestMdmcalls
        ./testserver ../server/ncidd
        ./ncid 3334

    Press <ENTER> to send the first line
    Press <ENTER> to keep sending lines until program terminates
