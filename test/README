The files ncidd-errors.conf and ncidd-noerrors.conf are
used to test the configuration of ncidd.  Neither config
file will permit ncidd to run after the config file is read.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The file testscript.data is a test file for ncid output modules,
like ncid-page and ncid-speak.

To test ncid-page: cat testscript.data | ncidpage

-----------------------------------------------------------

The file "aliasfile" is used to test "cidalias".

-----------------------------------------------------------

The program testclient is a NCID test server used to send various
NCID lines to test a client.  The test server uses port 3000.  It
sends one or more lines from the testclient.data file with each
press of <RETURN>.  The last <RETURN> will terminate the server.
Blank lines are used to terminate a send initiated by <RETURN>.

To test a client:
	Start testclient (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	Start the NCID client on port 3000 (it will receive the 200 line)
	Press <RETURN> to send a MSG lines
	Press <RETURN> to send a CIDLOG lines
	Press <RETURN> to send one CID (call) line (there is more than one)
	Press <RETURN> to send one CID and CIDINFO lines (there is more than one)
	Press <RETURN> to end testclient

	Usage: testclient [datafile]
	Default Data File: testclient.data

	NOTE: testclient and testclient.data must be in the same directory

-----------------------------------------------------------

The file testlog is a cidcall.log test file for clients and tools that
display the logfile.  Normally you would start the server and tell it
to use this logfile and look at the client display.  You could use
cidlog to display the file.

The file testlog-display is how ncid will display it.
