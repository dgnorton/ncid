The file testscript.data is a test file for ncid helper scripts,
like ncid-page and ncid-speak.

To test ncid-page: cat testscript.data | ncidpage

The program testclient is a NCID test server used to send various
NCID lines to test a client.  The test server uses port 3000.  It
sends one or more lines from the testclient.data file with each
press of <RETURN>.  The last <RETURN> will terminate the server.
Blank lines are used to terminate a send initiated by <RETURN>.

To test a client:
	Start testclient (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	Start the NCID client on port 3000 (it will receive the 200 line)
	Press <RETURN> to send a MSG lines
	Press <RETURN> to send a CIDLOG lines
	Press <RETURN> to send one CID (call) line (there is more than one)
	Press <RETURN> to send one CID and CIDINFO lines (there is more than one)
	Press <RETURN> to end testclient

	Usage: testclient [datafile]
	Default Data File: testclient.data

	NOTE: testclient and testclient.data must be in the same directory
