The files in this directory are used as follows:
------------------------------------------------

aliasfile:
    Used to test "cidalias".

ncidd-errors.conf:
ncidd-noerrors.conf:
    Used to test the configuration of ncidd.  Neither config
    file will permit ncidd to run after the config file is read.

testclient:
testclient.data:
    The program is a NCID test server used to send various NCID
    lines to test a client.  The test server uses port 3000.  It
    sends one or more lines from the testclient.data file with each
    press of <RETURN>.  The last <RETURN> will terminate the server.
    Blank lines are used to terminate a send initiated by <RETURN>.

    To test a client:
	    Start testclient (it will give instructions and send a 200 line)
	    Start the NCID client on port 3000 (it will receive the 200 line)
	    Press <RETURN> to send 2 MSG lines
	    Press <RETURN> to send 5 CIDLOG lines
	    Press <RETURN> to send one CID (call) line (there are 4 CID lines)
	    Press <RETURN> to send one CID and CIDINFO lines (there are 3 groups)
	    Press <RETURN> to end testclient

	    Usage: testclient [datafile]
	    Default Data File: testclient.data

	    NOTE: testclient and testclient.data must be in the same directory

testlog:
testlog-display:
    Testlog contains test data that is sent to clients at start.
    It is used as the cidcall.log file.

    Testlog-display is how ncid will display testlog.

testscript.data:
    A test file for ncid output modules, like ncid-page and ncid-speak.
    To test ncid-page: cat testscript.data | ncidpage

testserver:
    This program is used to test ncidd or a client.  The server is
    optioned for "noserial" mode, verbose level 3, and port 3334.
    The test server can be run at the same time as one in actual use.

    It will create needed empty files that have a name that start with
    "T-".  The config and alias files can be populated.  All "T-*"
    files can be removed when testing is finished.

    Usage: testserver {FULLY_QUALIFIED_PATH/ncidd} [-nciddOption(s)]

    Example: run the test server in verbose level 4:
        testserver /usr/sbin/ncidd -v4
