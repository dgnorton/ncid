NCID - Network CallerID

See the doc directory for all documentation, including OS
specific README's and INSTALL files, but the FreeBSD
documentation is in the FreeBSD directory.

See the tools directory for the documentation on ncidtools.

The NCID package contains:
	- a Network CalleID server: ncidd
	  ncidd runs on Linux, TiVo, BSD UNIX, and Macintosh OS X
	- a Network CallerID client: ncid
	  ncid runs on UNIX/Linux/Windows/Macintosh using tcl/tk
	- tools to work with the CID log and alias files: ncidtools
	  ncidtools runs on UNIX and Linux, but not the TiVo
    - client output modules and a log rotate module: ncidscripts

NCIDD is a TCP/IP Caller ID Daemon.  It was initially based
on the python CIDD program, which is part of the CID package
from tummy.com:  http://www.tummy.com/cid/

NCIDD monitors a modem or serial device for Caller ID and makes
it available over the network.  It also makes use of aliases to
change the NUMBER and/or NAME received, before it is sent to the
NCID clients.

NCID has the following features:

	- The server allows a number of clients.
	- The server does Name/Number aliases, so the display can be
	  customized.  For example: "Wireless Caller" becomes "John on Cell".
	- The server logs all calls.  Track who called when.
	- The server has a config file to set most options and aliases.
	- The server shares the modem for outgoing calls.
    - The server supports CID devices like NetCallerID
	- The server runs on Linux, UNIX, Macintosh OS X, and the TiVo.
    - The server and client spport Distinctive Ring
	- The client displays the Caller ID Log and adds to it whenever
	  it receives the CID information from the server.
	- The client runs on Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh OS X.
	- The protocol is documented so additional clients can be added.
