NCID - Network CallerID

Web Site: http://ncid.sourceforge.net

The NCID package contains:
    - a Network CallerID server: ncidd
      ncidd runs on Linux/TiVo/UNIX/Macintosh OSX/Cygwin
    - a Network CallerID client: ncid
      ncid runs on Linux/TiVo/UNIX/Windows/Mac OSX/Cygwin (requires tcl/tk)
    - client output modules and a configuration script for them
    - A SIP Invite Gateway: sip2ncid
      sip2ncid runs on Linux/UNIX/Windows/Mac OSX/Cygwin
    - YAC to NCID gateway client: yac2ncid (requires a yac server to input CID)
      yac2ncid Linux/UNIX/Cygwin/Mac
    - tools to work with the CID log and alias files: ncidtools
      ncidtools runs on Linux/UNIX/Mac OSX/Cygwin/TiVo (requires Perl)
    - a log rotate module
    - init scripts for Fedora, FreeBSD, and Ubuntu

    Recomend sip2ncid instead of ncidsip
    - A SIP Invite Gateway: ncidsip
      ncidsip runs on Linux/UNIX/Windows/Mac OSX/Cygwin (requires Perl)

The server, ncidd, is a TCP/IP Caller ID Daemon.  It either monitors a modem
or serial device for Caller ID, or obtains it from a CID client.  It sends
the CID information over the network to its clients.  The server can alias
the NUMBER, NAME, NUMBER and NAME, and LINE identifier received before it
is sent to its clients.

The NCID package has the following features:

    Server Features (ncidd):
    - Allows a number of clients.
    - Does Name/Number/Line aliases, so the display can be customized.
      For example: "Wireless Caller" becomes "John on Cell".
    - Logs all calls:  Track who called when.
    - Has a configuration file to set most options and aliases.
    - Shares the modem for outgoing calls.
    - Supports CID devices like NetCallerID
    - Runs on Linux, UNIX, Macintosh OS X, and the TiVo.
    - Supports Distinctive Ring
    - Supports Multiline (1 POTS and 1 or more VoIP lines)
      VoIP supports requires a SIP Invite Client
    - Send important error messages to the clients.
    - Send a message received from a client to all connected clients.
    - Clients can send a CID message to the server
    - Documented protocol

    Client Features (ncid):
    - Displays the Caller ID Log and adds to it whenever it receives
      the CID information from the server.
    - Displays messages received from the server.
    - Supports Distinctive Ring and Multiline
    - Supports output modules to customize its output and to display
      CID on devices like cell phones.
    - Runs on Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh OS X.
    - Can send a message to all active clients using the server
    - Can have multiple ncid clients
    - Documented protocol

    CID gateway Features (sip2ncid)

    - Creates a CID Message and sends it to the NCID server
    - indicates call answered or not answered
    - Handles multiple VoIP Lines
    - Indicates the telephone line by the last 4 digits
    - can have multiple ncidsip clients, each monitoring VoIP hardware
    - Documented protocol

    CID gateway Features (ncidsip)
    - Receives Caller ID information from SIP Invite
    - Creates a CID Message and sends it to the NCID server
    - indicates call not answered
    - Handles multiple VoIP Lines
    - Indicates the telephone line by the last 4 digits
    - can have multiple ncidsip clients, each monitoring VoIP hardware
    - Documented protocol

    CID gateway Features (yac2ncid)
    - Receives Caller ID information from a YAC server
    - Creates a CID Message and sends it to the NCID server
    - telephone line can be indicated in yac2ncid.conf
    - Documented protocol
