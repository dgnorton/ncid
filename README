The NCID package contains:
    - a Network CallerID server: ncidd
      ncidd runs on Linux/TiVo/UNIX/Macintosh OSX/Cygwin
    - a Network CallerID client: ncid
      ncid runs on Linux/TiVo/UNIX/Windows/Mac OSX/Cygwin (requires tcl/tk)
    - client output modules and a configuration script for them
    - a Network CallerID hangup client: ncidhangup
    - A NCID to NCID gateway: ncid2ncid
    - A Android smart phone app 'Remote Notifier' to NCID gateway: rn2ncid
    - A SIP Invite Gateway: sip2ncid
      sip2ncid runs on Linux/UNIX/Windows/Mac OSX/Cygwin
    - A Whozz Calling Ethernet Link device gateway: wc2ncid
      wc2ncid is a Perl program and runs on Linux/UNIX/Windows/Mac OSX/Cygwin
    - A YAC to NCID gateway: yac2ncid (requires a yac server to input CID)
      yac2ncid runs on Linux/UNIX/Cygwin/Mac
    - tools to work with the CID log and alias files: ncidtools
      ncidtools runs on Linux/UNIX/Mac OSX/Cygwin/TiVo (requires Perl)
    - a log rotate module
    - init and service scripts for Fedora
    - init scripts for Ubuntu
    - rc scripts for FreeBSD

The server, ncidd, is a TCP/IP Caller ID Daemon.  It either monitors a modem
or serial device for Caller ID, or obtains it from a CID gateway.  It sends
the CID information over the network to its clients.  The server can alias
the NUMBER, NAME, NUMBER and NAME, and LINE identifier received before it
is sent to its clients.

The telco always sends the CID between RING 1 and RING 2.  If ncidd does
not receive the CID by RING 2, ncidd can be configured to indicate a call
by sending RING as the number and "No CID From Modem" as the name.  This
permits NCID to display a visual indication of a call along with the date
and time.  This requires of a modem that indicates RING.

The ncidd server also sends outgoing calls and hangup calls from a blacklist.
Outgoing calls require a gateway that handles outgoing calls.
Call Hangups require a modem to hangup the call.

The NCID package has the following features:

    Server Features (ncidd):
    - Handles CID information from a modem, device or gateway.
    - Handles calls from modems that indicate ring but not Caller ID.
    - Handles outgoing or hangup calls from gateways that support them.
    - Shares the modem for outgoing calls.
    - Supports CID devices like NetCallerID
    - Supports VoIP using a SIP gateway: sip2ncid
    - Supports outgoing calls if SIP supports it
    - Supports multiple POTS lines if using the rn2ncid gateway
      instead of modems.
    - Allows multiple clients and gateways.
    - Does Name/Number/Line aliases, so the display can be customized.
      For example: "Wireless Caller" becomes "John on Cell".
    - Can alias the telephone line identifier
    - Logs all calls:  Track who called when.
    - Has a configuration file to set most options and aliases.
    - Runs on Linux, UNIX, Macintosh OS X, TiVo and Windows using Ubuntu
      or Cygwin.
    - Supports Distinctive Ring
    - Supports Multiline (1 POTS and 1 or Gateways)
    - Supports a remote modem using a YAC Gateway
    - Send important error messages to the clients.
    - Send a message received from a client to all connected clients.
    - Reloads the alias file when it receives a SIGHUP signal.
    - Sends ring count or -1 for hangup before answer or -2 for hangup after
      answer if input device supports it.
    - supports sending outgoing calls to clients if received from a gateway
    - Automatically terminates a telephone call using a modem if name or
      number is in the blacklist file but not in a whitelist file.
    - Reloads the alias, blacklist, and whitelist files when it receives
      a SIGHUP signal.
    - Documented protocol

    Client Features (ncid):

    - Fonts for the history window and call area can be changed and saved.
    - Time of call can be either 24 or 12 hour format.
    - Date of call can be mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy
    - Date separator can be either '/', '-', or '.'
    - Displays the number in a specific country format:
      US, Sweden, United kingdom, Germany, Croatia, or no format.
    - Displays the Caller ID log file in the call history window.
    - Displays the current Caller ID when a call is received.
    - Displays outgoing calls if they are supported by the server
    - Displays call hangup if supported by the server
    - Displays call blocked if supported by a gateway
    - Displays Caller ID from a smart phone
    - Displays a notice of a smart phone message
    - Displays messages received from the server.
    - Supports Distinctive Ring and multiple telephone lines.
    - Supports output modules to customize its output and to send NCID
      calls and messages to cell phones, tablets, pagers or email.
    - Can call a output module on a specific ring count or hangup indicator
    - Can send a message to all active clients using the server
