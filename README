The NCID package contains:
    - a Network CallerID server: ncidd
      ncidd runs on Linux, TiVo, BSD UNIX, and Macintosh OS X
    - a Network CallerID client: ncid
      ncid runs on UNIX/Linux/Windows/Macintosh using tcl/tk
    - tools to work with the CID log and alias files: ncidtools
      ncidtools runs on UNIX and Linux, but not the TiVo
    - client output modules and a configuration script for them
    - a log rotate module for Fedora

The server, ncidd, is a TCP/IP Caller ID Daemon.  It monitors a modem
or serial device for Caller ID and makes the information available over
